# leetcode<br>
　　This is my first time of challenging leetcode, of course it's a hard time for me. Such as this problem, I have undergone these period of times.<br>
1.<br>　
First, I used C language to solve it, but I failed when I meet negative numbers cause the array index has no negative number. So then I turned to learn STL. Fortunately, I learned C++ in this term, so it spent a little time to handle the map container. Thirdly, I use map container to solve this problem, but you know, map container has no repeated elements, so I search another way to solve it. And then I see the unordered_map container, but my codeblocks doesn't support it. Luckily, it's easy to solve by Google. At last, I spent a lot of time to solve the extream case and I overcome it. Finally!!!!!!!<br>
　　The thread of this problem is hash. It uses index skillfully. But at the last period, I meet this problem. When the nums is [3,3] and the target is 6, my function return [1,1] at that time, so it useful to add a condition of "m[t]!=i" in "if()".<br>
I don't want to give unnecessary details cause it has a lot on the website. So I write these sentences to mark this first time.<br>

The second problem gives me a tip, if you can list the condition in a parallel way, you won't write them with a nesting way. I don't know what's wrong if I write the conditions with nesting, but only if I list them in one "if()", the program adopted. Why???<br>
3.<br>
What I did was complying with the question, step by step and slove it.<br>
4.<br>
I list two solutions, cause my solution was too bad. The simple one may think about a little time.<br>
